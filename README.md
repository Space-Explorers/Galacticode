Looking to mix up a backend with express/sequelize and a frontend with react/redux? That's `boilermaker`!

Follow along with the workshop to make your own! This canonical version can serve as a reference, or a starting point all on its own.

## Setup

To use this boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on Github and clone it to your local machine)
* Run the following commands:

```
git remote add boilermaker https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker.git
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

Why did we do that? Because every once in a while, `boilermaker` may be updated with additional features or bug fixes, and you can easily get those changes from now on by entering:

```
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```


## Start

`npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.
