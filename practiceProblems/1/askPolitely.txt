Create the function askPolitely that accepts a sentence as an argument.
If the last character of the sentence is a question mark, then make sure the question ends with the word "please?".

If a question is already polite(meaning it already ends with "please") or the sentence is not a question, then return the inputted string without modification.

	Examples:
- INPUT: askPolitely("May I borrow your pencil?");
- OUTPUT: "May I borrow your pencil please?"


	- INPUT: askPolitely("May I ask a question please?");
- OUTPUT: "May I ask a question please?"


	- INPUT: askPolitely("My name is Grace Hopper.");
- OUTPUT: "My name is Grace Hopper.";
